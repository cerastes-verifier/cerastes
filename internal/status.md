## M4.5d2b1 — partnerless results, owning locals, marked locals (2026-11-05): done on branch `m4.5d2b1-results-locals`

Plan: `.claude/plans/m4-5d2b1-results-locals.md`. Record 0052 (amends 0029, 0037, 0038, 0042, 0045, 0047, 0050). The
branch stacks on S7's `s7-code-style` (`a660abc`, not merged yet; the owner was away). Read `internal/handoff.md` next:
§2 (owner steps), §3 "From M4.5d2b1" and "M4.5d2b2", §4.2.

**Owner decisions:** at planning (2026-11-05): 150, 151 (S7's: long lines and `{ // comment` lines as touched; **no
comment on a line with a brace** from now on, in `CLAUDE.md` and the developer guide), 152 (M4.5d2b split: d2b1 now,
d2b2 next), 153 (`cerastes_owns_vlibc_block`), 154 (a `ref_to_uninit` function's returns under `--strict-init`), 155
(`must_init` stays parameter-only). During the session, each the recommendation: 156, 157 (spike S38: a covered atom's
amount is `write`; a covered `live` gives pointer use only), 158, 159 (audit round 1: bodiless contracts give only fresh
results; only implicit atoms cover), 160 (new tests' expect lines corrected after their first run for their designed
reason), 161 (two flipped pins expect two real errors).

**Done** (worktree `.claude/worktrees/m4.5d2b`; three Sonnet agents, edg-backend, test-mutator and il-analyst — the first
il-analyst ran out of context after Part A and the straight-line owners, and a fresh one of the same role did the loops
and the audit fixes — and one read-only Opus auditor: round 1 on the draft and S38, round 2 on the code, a re-audit with
the loops, and a targeted check of its fixes)
- `c77e27c` planning; `07324a3` record 0052's draft (revised after S38 and audit round 1) and P74 in `il-inventory.md`.
- `7ac8e8e` Parts A–D: partnerless `ensures` atoms (covered or given with an output amount; bodiless contracts: fresh
  results only, an allow-list), owning automatic locals (ghosts, value row, owners, ending rows at every exit and
  reassignment, assignments inside expressions, loops with keyed read-only owners and one carrier per block), marked
  locals and P4222R3's strict rules, block-site guards that read memory, `owning` beside `owns_block`, `restrict` backed
  by block sites, `free`'s sequencing, partners by path for block sites (a d2a hole), `cerastes_owns_vlibc_block`; the
  lint; VIR self-test 1642 cases; about 300 new tests, 3 S38 smoke fixtures; six pins retired.
- `543a897` docs: Memory and ownership, Annotations, Verifying, Error messages, the tutorial's heap chapter (an owner),
  `internal/encoding.md`.
- **Flips** (the plan's list and questions 160–161; `build/m4.5d2b/expect-corrections.md` lists every new test's
  correction): `reject_atom_on_result.c` → `error permission @ L12`; `reject_owns_result_double_deref.c` → `permission @
  L9` and `@ L11`; `reject_owns_result_member_target.c` → `lifetime @ L14`, `permission @ L15`;
  `reject_struct_value_live_result.c` → `lifetime @ L15`, `permission @ L16`; retired for positives:
  `reject_owning_local.c`, `reject_ref_to_uninit_local.c`, `reject_owns_block_guard_heap_requires.c`,
  `reject_owns_block_guard_heap_ensures.c`, `reject_owns_block_guard_global_ensures.c`, `reject_owns_block_restrict.c`;
  message and Pins only: the plan's list, with `reject_ensures_atom_no_partner.c` and
  `reject_owns_block_ensures_no_partner.c` staying rejected (record 0052 items 2 and 2a).
- **Checks:** the final run of `tests/memory tests/vlibc tests/annotations doc/modules/ROOT/examples` (6326 passed; the
  23 failures were the six retired pins and three issues fixed and re-run as a delta: 248 passed); `vprdiff.py` against
  S7's baseline: every existing output byte-identical but four map-only message changes (allow-listed); the lint clean;
  `scripts/format.sh --check` clean; `check.sh` (the full check, `CERASTES_CHECK_BASE` unset, run once at `268fb17`'s tree): all green (1642 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; lint 4338 files clean; VIR self-test 1642 lowering cases, 273 rejection cases, 0 problems; docs and walker oracle clean; `build/m4.5d2b/check1.log`).

**Not done:** written `owns_block` in loop invariants (cut (a), to d2b2); the Linux run on the x86-64 box (CI decides
when the owner pushes); the documented false alarms of handoff §3 "From M4.5d2b1".

**Surprises:** a covered atom's amount formula gave 0 (question 156); liveness cells are not injective (question 157); a
bodiless partnerless atom could make a caller's state impossible, and the same hole existed since d2a for `owns_block`
results and guarded block sites (questions 158, audit 2 B1–B2); the owning-loop invariant needed `held_v == (v != null)`
and entry snapshots, which then needed rows for blocks that become shared; a given amount is unknown to the caller; the
test-mutator's hand-backs were twice lost while it waited on finished background runs (the run itself was not hung).

**First step for the next session:** M4.5d2b2's planning (plan.md's row; handoff §3 "M4.5d2b2" and "From M4.5d2b1"),
after S7 and this branch merge.
