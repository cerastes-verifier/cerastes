# Handoff after M4.5b2a — globals and `static` locals (record 0041) (2026-10-30); M4.5b2b in progress (record 0042, 2026-11-02)

The next session reads this file after `CLAUDE.md`, its own section in `plan.md`, `internal/status.md` and
`internal/decisions/`. `status.md` has the formal entry. This file adds what a cold start would otherwise have to
rediscover, and holds only what is live (owner, 2026-10-26; consolidated again at M4.5b2b's start, 2026-11-02: §3 is
regrouped by the session that consumes each note). The text before this consolidation is
`git show 38877b4:internal/handoff.md`, whose header names every earlier version (each note below keeps its origin in
brackets, so its full wording can be found there). Session plans approved from M4.5b1a on are in `.claude/plans/`; the
notes a session consumes move into its plan.

## 1. State

- **On `origin/main`** (`38877b4`): everything through M4.5b2a (PR #21 M4.5b1c3, PR #22 M4.5b2a). M4.5b1 and M4.5b2a are
  complete; the local `main` of the main checkout is the same commit.
- **M4.5b2b** (P4222's markers, `--strict-init`, record 0042) is in progress on branch `m4.5b2b-init-markers` in the
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/m4.5b2b`, from `38877b4` (plan `.claude/plans/m4-5b2b-init-markers.md`). Its baseline is
  taken in the detached worktree `.claude/worktrees/m4.5b2b-base` at `38877b4`, so the main checkout is not touched.

The EDG pin is unchanged (`f0ed5525af`); the fork's `cerastes` is 29 commits behind upstream `main` (§4.1).

## 2. Owner steps

None during M4.5b2b. At its end: push `m4.5b2b-init-markers` and open its PR (the status entry gives the commands);
after the merge, `git merge --ff-only origin/main` in the main checkout, and `git worktree remove` of the two session
worktrees.

## 3. Open notes, by the session that consumes them

One line per note, its origin in brackets (session and audit item); the full wording is in the commit named above.
Notes that a session consumes move into its plan's "Inputs" (M4.5b2b took the call's flag row, the registration rule for
P4222's markers, P54 and the b2b design points).

**M4.5c Structs**
- Places reached through a heap read: `owns(**pp)`, `live(*pp)`, `**pp` in contracts (question 74, §4.2); a `T**` callee
  cannot use the pointer it loads from `*pp` until then [b1c3].
- Register `owning`'s target `d` here, never earlier: `check_attributes` skips registered attributes [M4.5a].
- Struct copies must not clear the flag of a cell the function holds: record 0042's `internal` row for `ref_to_uninit`
  (`old(flag) ==> flag`, question 87) relies on it [b2b].
- Accepted completeness gap: `&s.x < &s.y` is reported (members are different blocks) [M4.5a].

**M4.5d1 vlibc**
- P55: the attribute allow-list rejects a system declaration's attributes (`[[const]]`, `[[alloc_size]]`, `[[__cold__]]`)
  once a user or vlibc file redeclares the function; check an attribute by its own position [M4.5a].
- vlibc's headers come through `--sys_include`, so EDG flags them as system: the macro exemption of record 0031 item 9
  must count vlibc's library class as a verified file or exclude it before vlibc lands (add it to 0030 item 4's audit
  list) [S5].

**M4.5d2 `malloc` and `free`**
- Register `owning`'s `r` and `v` and `ref_to_uninit`'s `v` and `r` here, in the commit that handles them [M4.5a, b2b].
- `alloc_<t>` does not ensure `block_of(r) != GB_g()`, so `&x != &g` is not proved in a function that holds nothing of
  `g` [b2a audit 1 N3].
- `return &s;` of a `static` local leaves the caller only `WF(r)`, so its uses are `lifetime`
  (`static_local_return_address_use.c`) until `ensures` atoms land [b2a].

**M4.5e1/e2 Arrays and pointer arithmetic:** P38's braced initializers (§4.2); signed/unsigned and enumeration variants
through `void*` cannot be written [M4.5a].

**M4.5f1/f2 Predicates**
- `pure` bodies now reject globals and `static` locals (0041 item 12) [b2a]; R1–R13 do not reach `pure`/`predicate`
  bodies, and `static_assert_pure_body.c`'s listed entry goes stale when bodies are encoded [M4.4c].
- A list traversal's truth tests need liveness inside f2's predicates; `forperm` sees only top-level tokens [M4.5a].

**M4.6 Chars and strings**
- `main(int, char **)` in a unit with globals is not the entry and fails closed, but its message asks for `reads(g)` in a
  contract on `main`, which is rejected; M4.6 makes `main(argc, argv)` the entry [b2a audit 2 N3].
- `const` objects as cells (question 78, §4.3); `c | 0x20` case bits (0027).

**M4.7 Function pointers:** keep `&main` rejected, so `program_start` is reached once [b2a audit 1 N10].

**M4.8 C parity close-out**
- The cost of aliasing `reads`/`live` parameters (question 66): the cell splits at calls were checked by timing, not
  re-audited (four and five parameters 5.7 s and 22 s, six time out with exit 3, documented) [b1b]; entry case splits
  multiply loop verification (one guarded parameter and one cell 2.7 s, two and three 37 s; four aliasing `reads` with a
  loop about 50 s under load); tests stay at three or fewer [b1c1]; the slowest b1c2 tests take 9–14 s under load 150–175
  [b1c2].
- Written atoms on moved pointers (question 79): a written atom whose pointer the loop moves keeps its entry liveness
  amount, a pinned false alarm (`tests/memory/negative/loop_written_moved_owns_false_alarm.c`) [b1c3 round 2 S4].
- A loop over `reads(*p)` and a global written by name may need intermediate asserts for Silicon to keep `*p`'s value
  (prover incompleteness, not the encoding) [b2a audit 2 N2].
- Exit-3 hazard, no case known: Silicon continuing past a failed explicit check and tripping over its own check on a
  store through an unknown pointer (found once in `main`, fixed by splitting against every held global in
  `result_splits`; no general guard) [b2a].
- Mutation: the mask positives were never mutated (question 49), nor the verified doc examples (question 10) [M4.4d].
- From the mutation review: the doc example `verifying/void_conditional.c` keeps a redundant `requires` conjunct (four
  listed equivalents); a body `p | q` against an exact `&` contract runs to the timeout (0023's limit), so
  `not_eq_and_bools` states its contract with `&&` [M4.4c].
- Masks that are constants only through a call argument (`f(v, 4294967295u)` with `requires((v & m) == v)`): Silicon's own
  precondition check may run to the timeout (exit 3; question 51); the exact-set fallback keeps today's false alarms
  (question 50) [M4.4d].

**M5.0 and M5** (also §4.4)
- `mutate.py`'s classifier does not read local declarations (about 20 listed equivalents rest on a reviewer's reading),
  before M5a; a user C++ function named `assert` would be bucketed by `mutate.py` [S3 note 1].
- Templates [M2 audit B]: a predicate called inside a `forall` lambda in a function template's contract is falsely
  rejected (`spec_call_in_code`); the `operator=` branch of `spec_marker_on_special_member` lost its test; P changes
  overload choice where constant evaluation is a substitution failure (two tests to add); 2–3 tests for the back end's
  constant-context pass in never-instantiated templates; a class-scope `static_assert(q(sizeof(T)))` in a
  never-instantiated class template is accepted (harmless); EDG at P leaves an error node without a diagnostic for a
  `decltype(p)` lambda parameter (`annotation_substitution_error` is load-bearing, M5b fork commit R).
- A closed 128-bit claim over a shifted constant other than 1 is undecided (folding `k * c_pow2(n)` would change
  existing Viper) [M4.4b1 note 6].

**M8 Inventory** (the warning sweep is an M8 entry in `plan.md`)
- Warnings: EDG's #550 on a global that code only writes and only contracts read (clang and GCC are silent; tests read
  such globals in code) [b2a]; record 0025 item 6's "still accepted" shapes (`RED == RED`, clang's
  `-Wparentheses-equality`, `-Wswitch-bool`, `-Wfor-loop-analysis`, `-Wmisleading-indentation`, GCC's
  `-Wmultistatement-macros`, clang's `-Wempty-body` on loops, R10 with a named constant or a constant expression, R7 not
  looking into a `?:` arm that is a comma ending in a constant); untested shapes `else ;` and `do ; while (c);` [M4.4c].
- Rejected more broadly than the compilers [M4.4c]: R13's `;` on the line after the condition and an empty macro
  invocation as the body; R7's `*` through both `?:` arms in every conversion to `bool`; R9 on a 0 or 1 right operand from
  a macro and R11 on an operand from a macro under a written `&&`. R10 and R11 apply in code only, R5 and R9 in
  annotations too (question 44).
- Over-strict, listed: `bool b = &g`, `!&g`, `&g == NULL`, `static int b = (&g == &h)`, C++ `static int *p = &a` of a
  `static` local [b2a audit 2 N6]; C++'s multi-level qualification conversion (`int**` → `const int* const*`), a
  definition that must repeat its prototype's `owning`, two indistinguishable declarations with `owning` [b1c3];
  `(*p = f(a)) + (*q = g(b))` stays `unsequenced_calls`, a caller breaking an exclusion resting on a value `requires` is
  reported `permission` before `precondition` [b1c2]; `restrict` beside a same-typed parameter with only `live` [b1b];
  `a && (y = x = 1);` and a discarded `a && (flag = x);` with a `bool` target [M4.3b note 5]; the pragma rule rejects
  harmless `#pragma clang/GCC diagnostic` (an allow-list would lift it) [M4.2b1 note 1].
- C++'s `p == NULL ? d : *p` with a `const` pointee stays rejected (an lvalue `?:`), with a readable message [b1b].
- Mode differences, not meanings: `x = ((void)(a > 0 && x > 0), 2)` is `uninitialized` in C and rejected in C++; `x ? RED :
  GREEN` as a value accepted in C and rejected in C++ (0018 item 8) [M4.4c]; `c >= +GREEN` accepted in C, rejected in C++
  [M4.2c note 1].
- Not on an allow-list, no wrong verdict: asm labels on globals; a user `environ`/`__progname` without the system header
  (fine on macOS, Linux unchecked) [b2a audit 2 N5].

**Standing** (no session; act when the code is next touched)
- *By design:* C++17 sequences `g += f()` and `*p = (**pp = 5)` (the right operand first), but 0039's C rule stays in both
  modes [b2a N9, b1c3 N4]; `return p = &x;` and `int *r = &x; return r;` stay accepted (the caller's first use fails
  `lifetime`; questions 65, 70) and EDG's #1056 prints beside an R14 rejection [b1c2]; in an invariant `==` is identity
  with no liveness check [b1c1 note 7].
- *Messages:* `int *volatile gp` is named "volatile int *" [b2a N7]; an `annotation_mismatch` between declarations written
  by one macro names the parameter by position [b1c3]; `cerastes_old(*p)` in a loop invariant is rejected in C as "a
  conversion to or from a pointer type", in C++ as `old_outside_ensures` [b1c1]; rejection texts end "(decision 0012)" or
  "(decision 0037)" where a later record decides them, and the type message still says "only integer types, bool and the
  enumerations … are" [M4.2a–M4.2c, b1a, b1c1]; a block-scope `extern const` naming an internal-linkage C++ constant is
  called "a static local variable" [M4.2b1 note 2]; C's `case -1:` over an enumeration prints 4294967295 [M4.4a note 7];
  `d == (x ? (y, RED) : GREEN)` gives one diagnostic in C, two in C++ [M4.4b1 note 2]; lowering's
  internal-inconsistency diagnostics have no position; two failing `requires` clauses at one call print the same
  message twice (tests choose contracts that fail once) [M4.4d].
- *Positions:* with a `continue` in the body, a written atom's back-edge error is reported at the loop statement
  [b1c3 N3]; a loop body without braces likewise (no test) [b1c1 S5]; in C++20 a loop's IL position is its first
  attribute's (P59).
- *Fail-closed checks and their limits:* the memory-order check cannot see obligations that read cells, inline reads, or
  a set that is too large (0039 item 4, 0026 item 4; pinned by the audits' probes) [b1c2]; the termination-set fix was
  not re-audited (smaller sets are the safe direction; `noreturn_call_in_expression_termination.c`) [b1c2]; item 2's
  checks of M4.4c read the placement emission uses, a set computed too large is still invisible (pins
  `call_write_noreturn_divzero.c`, `never_returns_call_divzero.c`) [M4.4c]; `Acc::owner` can point at a dead stack `Full`
  of a then-arm while the else-arm is lowered (safe today; a heap-stable id would be sturdier) [b1c2 note 2].
- *Trusted reasoning checked by counterexample, not proof:* `f__wf`'s added facts (aliasing values equal, a `reads`
  place's post value equals its pre value, `owns` pairs distinct in one clause list) [b1b]; by-name cell checks are
  `permission`, so an encoder bug dropping a cell's permission would read as a user error (a VIR hook could pin it) [b1b].
- *Not re-audited* (the cap): b1c3's second B1 fix (in a contract, every pointer conversion changing pointee
  qualifiers, and `owns`/`owning` of a `const` place, rejected; pinned by `reject_contract_qualifier_*`,
  `reject_owns_const_*`, `reject_owning_const_int.c`) [b1c3].
- *Self-test pins:* the VIR self-test's written-atom cases pin failing rows by index (`fail_only(category, loc, count,
  index)`), so a change in row order breaks them, not a verdict [b1c3]; the VIR mask cases pass with either encoding by
  design [M4.4d round 2 note 10]; `calls_drop_exact_set_hook_off` duplicates `calls_fixed_order_hook_off` (harmless)
  [M4.4d].
- *Lint:* a `Perm` local as a non-first target of a multi-target call is not seen, an invariant's `acc` amount is not
  required to be a `Perm` local, and the "while without decreases" rule reads the first line holding `{` as the body
  [b1c1 note 8, M4.2a note 7]; the lint of `%` and `\` reads only the divisor and exempts the prelude bodies by name (the
  guarantee is structural: `low::mod_pow2`/`div_pow2`) [M4.4d]; `lint_flags` checks the flag on the line after the write
  only [M4.3a note 3].
- *Tooling:* `build/cerastes verify --keep-vpr` with no path writes `<stem>.vpr` into the current directory (P60) [b1c2];
  `mutate.py` does not mutate namespace-scope initializers, a literal mutated past `9223372036854775807` changes type,
  `--list` is slow under load, a mutation wrapper's cap must stay above the driver's `--timeout` (or Silicon processes are
  orphaned), `drop-complement` on a C++ destructor and `swap-bitwise` on `(T)&x` give stillborn mutants [M4.2b1 note 7,
  S3 note 2, M4.2a note 6, M4.4b1 notes 4, 7]; the walker oracle cannot tell an orphan closure copy from the used one, a
  phantom `on type <unnamed>` line could pass, and it lists neither a first declaration's own attribute after the
  parameter list nor one on a template definition [M2 audit B note 6, M4.4b2 note 5].
- *Driver and platforms* [S5]: `posix_spawn_file_actions_addchdir(_np)`'s result is not checked and Silicon is given the
  relative `program.vpr` (passing the absolute path removes it); `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` may not exist on a bare Ubuntu;
  C++'s `assert((bool)x)` loses the user's cast on Linux, `assert(E::b)` with a scoped enumeration compiles only under
  glibc; `__thread` and the x86 GNU attributes are accepted on Linux only (0031 item 7); a hand-written
  `((void)sizeof(x++), x) ? (void)0 : __assert_fail(…)` on Linux matches and verifies (sound; require the `sizeof`'s
  operand to be a call of `__assert_single_arg`); the glibc matcher's near misses can only run against glibc
  (question 59).
- *Recognition by name or shape:* `assert` by its macOS expansion and `__assert_rtn`; the character-literal trigger
  compares VIR type names (`int_kind` would be sturdier) [S3, M4.4b2 note 3]; the noreturn trust checks a routine's first
  declaration (source sequence lists, on since M4.4b2, can now make it exact, and the libc table's "declared only in
  system files") [M4.2a note 1].
- *Fail-closed corners and unreached guards:* `names_object` false on an unknown node kind; a C case value of an unknown
  shape; defensive branches with no test (M4.1's undetermined `break`/`continue` target, a non-integer scrutinee, a case
  value of another type; a declaration directly in an unflattened generated block; a `cerastes::` attribute on a label;
  `comparison()`'s raw operands of two enumerations; "an enumerator whose enumeration this version cannot find";
  `enum_case_value`'s constant without `expr`; the exit-3 paths for emitter problems and "encoded twice", only
  `--selftest` sets the flag) [M4.1–M4.4a].
- *Accepted shapes worth a test:* `0 && (x = 1)`, `1 || x++` (folded, rejected); `assert((note(x), x >= 0))` (rejected by
  `check_program`); `decltype(x++)` (accepted, clang warns); a `_Noreturn int main` in C23 (only C++ tested); a typedef
  whose first reason is not an array is rejected only at a use; `_Static_assert(1.5, "")` names its type in C but not in
  C++ [M4.3a, M4.2a, M4.4b2]. Not pinned: a bare `p;` with `p` dangling reports `lifetime` (EDG's #174, and #550 in C++,
  keep it out of `error` tests; the `(void)p;` twins pin the rule) [b1a].
- *Costs to watch:* liveness checks at every pointer use cost about 1.5–1.7× time and text on S26's scale program; deep
  `^` mask chains are fast to depth 32 for range claims, identities only to the measured depth (0027 item 4) [M4.5a].
- *EDG, not chased:* in C23, `typeof(*cp)` for a `const int* cp` drops `const` (P53; harmless for `cerastes_old`) [M4.5a].

## 4. Session plans

**Rules for every session** (memory `session-size-few-hours`): sized to what fits in one context, under about 12 h
unless a reason is given (owner, 2026-10-30, question 77; was ≤ 4 h), with fixed scope and stop rules; owner decisions and pre-approved expectation changes asked up front; the
decision record before code (invariant 6); must-verify/must-fail pairs (invariant 2); docs in the same session
(invariant 8); three Sonnet agents with disjoint files (edg-backend: `src/backend`, `src/driver`, build; il-analyst:
probes, IL evidence, Silicon spikes, `src/vir` + `src/viper`; test-mutator: tests, harness, compiler matrices, `mutate.py`,
`lint_viper.py`) and the Opus soundness-auditor (one round per diff plus a re-audit of blocking fixes; should-fix items
not taken go to §3); single-file runs while working (`build/cerastes verify` directly: `run_tests.py` locks `build/vpr`);
builds serialized (`lockf build/<session>/build.lock cmake --build build/cmake`); `check.sh` at most twice; the EDG
suites on the x86-64 host are their own session, but any x86-64 test run a session needs goes to `matt@clang4.cpp.al`
automatically (owner, 2026-10-29: not Docker multi-arch on the Mac, which is only the fallback when the host is down).
Record numbers are the next free ones when written (0042 is M4.5b2b's, 0043 the next free one). The
approved plan is saved as `.claude/plans/<milestone>-<topic>.md` (plan.md, "Session protocol").

Finished sessions: their plans are in `.claude/plans/` (from M4.5b1a on), their results in `internal/status.md` and the
commits it names. The warning sweep (was M4.4e) is an M8 entry in `plan.md`.

### 4.1 EDG box session (pending since M4.2c)

**EDG box session after M4.2c** (owner, 2026-10-22). The owner merged `0022` into the fork's `cerastes`
(`f0ed5525af`, which also brings upstream `main` `ec2f12cffa`, 11 commits after `21065e551e`) and M4.2c moved the pin
there (`check.sh` green, every `.vpr` byte-identical, the three #2656 tests added). Still to do on the box: (1) the full
suites at `f0ed5525af` in both 64-bit configurations (`changes,regressions,imported,edg,cwg,stdlib`; known `cwg1835`,
`cwg2881`), and whether `0022`'s `.rto` needs `edg_x86_32` overrides; (2) old §11 question 16: reproduce the C
enumerator-list typing on unmodified upstream and draft its bug file (no fork fix). Clean builds every run (memory:
stale binaries after a failed link). (3) **`#if`** (owner, 2026-10-23, M4.4b planning; old §11 question 32): EDG folds a
preprocessing expression with no diagnostic for an unsigned wrap (`#if 0u - 1 > 0`), and in C23 its signed overflow is
#61, a warning verify mode suppresses for bodies; nothing reaches the IL (`preproc.c:460-491`). A fork commit adds a
discretionary diagnostic, distinct from #61, for a preprocessing expression whose arithmetic wraps or overflows, with
`GH-*` tests and the full box suites before the pin moves; the cerastes driver then makes it an error in verify mode.
(4) **The upstream merge** (owner, 2026-10-29, M4.5b1c2 planning: deferred to this session rather than done at a
session start): the fork's `cerastes` is 29 commits behind upstream `main` (`a0325e00e6`, fetched 2026-10-30 at
M4.5b1c3's start); merge it
(never rebase), run the full suites on the box, then move the pin with `check.sh` green and the goldens' diffs reviewed.

### 4.2 M4.5 Pointers (sessions b1–f3; designed in M4.5a)

**The design** is records 0028 (the memory model: E2, the `Block` domain, liveness, explicit checks), 0029 (the
annotations and C's spec functions), 0030 (vlibc), 0032 (b1a's slice) and 0033–0036 (the four axioms); evidence in
`il-inventory.md` "M4.5a" and "M4.5b1a"; the encoding pinned by the fixtures in `tests/viper-smoke/memory/`.

**The VeriFast port inventory** is `build/m4.5a/ports.md` in the worktree (gitignored; its conclusions are below per
session). `malloc_block.c` holds no `malloc` (an address-taken struct local); `insertion_sort.c` is a linked list whose
ghost machinery is not portable as written (an array insertion sort in M4.5e2 replaces it as a benchmark); 14 of the 22
files run VeriFast with `-disable_overflow_check`, so their ports need `requires` bounds; `functions.c`'s predicate
families and constructors, consumed fractions, backward `goto` and `open_module` are M8 entries.

**M4.5b1 and M4.5b1c** were split by the owner (2026-10-28 and 2026-10-29): b1a, b1b, b1c1 and b1c2 are done (records
0032–0039; plans in `.claude/plans/`); owning results (`owning` on functions, `owns_block`, `owns(*result)`, `ensures`
atoms with no partner) moved to M4.5d2. Each session rejects what a later one makes precise (fail closed).
**Pre-approved** (owner): a session may retire or re-expect exactly the rejection pins listed for it below (or in its plan, when the
paragraph points at one), and no others; a pin whose construct stays rejected keeps its `expect:` line, and only its message and `Pins:` comment name the
new session.

**M4.5b2 is two sessions** (split at M4.5b2a's planning, 2026-10-30). **M4.5b2a** (globals and `static` locals) is done
(record 0041; plan `.claude/plans/m4-5b2a-globals.md`; flips of question 81). **M4.5b2b** (P4222's markers
`[[cerastes::uninit]]`, `ref_to_uninit` and `must_init` on parameters, `--strict-init`, the call's flag row as
`uninitialized`; record 0042) is in progress: its plan `.claude/plans/m4-5b2b-init-markers.md` holds its scope, inputs
(P54, questions 82–83 and 85–88, the self-test pins it re-expects) and flips.

**M4.5c Structs.** Members as blocks of their own (0028 item 16), `.` and `->`, struct values (copies, initializers,
by-value parameters and results), nested structs, pointers to members, `owns(*s)`, non-recursive owning fields
(`[[cerastes::owning]]` target `d`), and places reached through a heap read in contracts: `owns(**pp)`, `live(*pp)`
and reads of `**pp` (owner, 2026-10-30, question 74; b1c3 rejects them naming M4.5c). Ports: `malloc_block.c` (the address-taken struct local; its `free(&local)` twin
waits for M4.5d2), the struct half of `swap.c`.

**M4.5d1 vlibc** (needs the repository; any time after M4.5a, best after S5). The repository's layout
(`include/vlibc/*.h`, the shim directory, `src/`, CMake, `LICENSE`, CI compiling every header with clang and GCC in both
modes), `third_party/vlibc` pinned (0001), the driver's include order and the vlibc-file trust rule (0030 items 3–4,
P55), `abort`/`exit`/`_Exit` moved out of `trusted_libc_reason` with their tests' Viper unchanged.

**M4.5d2 `malloc` and `free`.** vlibc's contracts (`malloc` `ref_to_uninit`, `calloc` initialized, `realloc`, `free`),
heap blocks with the slot −1 token, the free checks (`invalid-free`), the leak rule by `forperm` and a record on `main`'s
leaks (`leak`), owning locals and globals (`[[cerastes::owning]]` target `v`), `[[cerastes::ref_to_uninit]]` on pointer
locals and functions (targets `v`, `r`: `malloc`'s result and a local receiving it; from M4.5b2b's planning), and
**owning results** (from b1c, owner
2026-10-29): `[[cerastes::owning]]` on functions (target `r`), `owns_block`, `owns(*result)` and `ensures` atoms with no
`requires` partner (a callee handing a place's permission to its caller: an output ghost amount). Flips:
`tests/memory/negative/reject_{atom_on_result,ensures_atom_no_partner}.c`. Ports: `account.c`, `deposit.c`, `swap.c`'s
`main`, `globals.c`, `malloc_block.c`'s `free` twin.

**M4.5e1 Arrays.** Local arrays as blocks, `a[i]`, array parameters, `owns_range` as quantified permissions over the
absolute slot, the marked range rows in the driver (owner, after S25), `forall` in C (0029 item 4: its planning decides
between pure functions with contracts and moving M4.5f1 first), sum and max. P38: a braced initializer with more than
1000 elements keeps no `expr` for its elements (`REDUCE_BACKING_EXPRESSION_USE`), only an `orig_type`; read every
element through `constant_value`, which rejects that shape, never through `ck_aggregate`'s values directly, or a
wrapping element would pass unchecked. M4.4b2's types computed from a constant (`sizeof`, `typeof`, typedefs). Port:
`carrays.c` (lists → `forall`; its `should_fail` at L35 and L42: below and one past the end).

**M4.5e2 Pointer arithmetic.** `p + i`, `p - i`, `p - q`, relational comparisons within one object, one-past-the-end,
`malloc(n * sizeof(T))`; `out-of-bounds`; relational comparisons and `p - q` under `pointer-comparison` (the category and
the `==` exception of 0028 item 3 land in M4.5b1b). Port: an array
insertion sort (in place of `insertion_sort.c`).

**M4.5f1 Predicates and pure functions.** Bodies encoded (0011 item 4 lifted), `fold`/`unfold`, non-recursive
predicates. Port: `cell.c`. §3's notes on R1–R13 not reaching `pure`/`predicate` bodies and `static_assert_pure_body.c`
go stale here.

**M4.5f2 Recursive predicates.** A linked list (push, pop, length), recursive owning fields (`next`), leaks inside
predicates (0028 item 6). Ports: `stack.c`, `sum.c`, `popn.c`.

**M4.5f3 Lemmas and ghost sequences.** Its record decides whether lemma functions and ghost sequences are in M4 (they
are needed for content specifications: `strlen`'s zero-terminated string, `memcpy`'s and `memcmp`'s contents).
`internal/upstream/attribute-registration.md` Appendix A lists the open design points. Ports: `reverse.c`, `sum_full.c`,
`push_all.c`.

### 4.3 M4.6–M4.8

**M4.6 Chars and strings:** string literals as read-only arrays, `char` buffers, vlibc's `<string.h>` (`strlen`,
`memcpy`, `memcmp`, `strcmp`: contracts, and implementations verified in vlibc's CI), `main(argc, argv)`; character
access to other objects stays rejected (0028 item 1); `c | 0x20`-style case bits are decided (0027). Ports:
`strlen.c`, `memcpy.c`, `memcmp.c`. Open point: a zero-terminated buffer of unknown length needs a recursive predicate or a
built-in notion (M4.5f3 decides). **`const` objects in the model** (owner, 2026-10-30, question 78, the recommendation):
field names ignore `const`, so record 0040 item 2 rejects, in a contract, every pointer conversion that changes pointee
qualifiers, every comparison across them and every `owns`/`owning` of a `const` place (fail closed, after M4.5b1c3's
audit round 2 B1 and its re-audit); `char *strchr(const char *s, int c)` with `ensures(r == NULL || r points into s)`
needs them. M4.6 models a `const` object as a cell the function holds below `write` after its initializer (record 0028
amended: allocation, scope exit and `owns` of a `const` place), then lifts those rules; `&K` of a `const` global and an
address-taken `const` local (M4.5b2a's pins `reject_address_of_const_global.c`, `reject_case_const_address_taken.cpp`)
come with it.

**M4.7 Function pointers:** contracts on function types, calls through pointers; ports of `tutorial_solutions/byref.c`,
`examples/functions/functions.c` (without its predicate families, an M8 entry).

**M4.8 C parity close-out:** the VeriFast C differential set (the ports above, run with VeriFast in Docker as M5c
sets up, or recorded outcomes), the full mutation run over the M4 tests and the verified doc examples never mutated
before (owner, 2026-10-27, §8 question 10), the mask positives with mutants of a mask constant counted as "undecided"
(§8 question 49), the cost of aliasing `reads`/`live` parameters (§8 question 66: fix it here, e.g. Silicon's joins
or a per-call split order; record 0037, Consequences), with it the false alarm of written atoms on moved pointers (owner,
2026-10-30, question 79, the recommendation: per-place liveness amounts at the loop head, or the share named by the
parameter's ghost amount; pinned by `tests/memory/negative/loop_written_moved_owns_false_alarm.c`, §3), the Memory and
ownership page complete, M4's acceptance (plan.md),
and the deferred list for M8
(unions, floating point, `volatile`/`_Atomic`/`_BitInt`/vector types, variadic functions and `printf`, several
translation units, concurrency).

### 4.4 M5.0 and M5 — type traits and generic templates (designed in the M4.1 session)

**M5.0 Type traits** (owner, 2026-10-26, old §11 question 39; `plan.md` "Before M5"). After M4.8 and before M5a. M4.4b2
skips a static assertion whose condition calls a function, uses a type trait (`enk_builtin_operation`, a variable
template such as `std::is_integral_v<T>`), a concept-id, or names an entity of a system header (`std::numeric_limits`).
M5.0 decides how cerastes reads such conditions (and type traits elsewhere: contracts, `if constexpr`), so that M5's
integral `T` and M6's requirement contracts rest on it. Planned at its own planning.

**Before M5: typed locals in the mutation classifier** (owner, 2026-10-27, §8 question 11: "Not now, but annotate that
this needs to be addressed before M5"). `mutate.py`'s classifier does not read local declarations, so about 20 listed
equivalents (e.g. `assert_holds.c`) rest on a reviewer's reading; teach it to read them, with its own audit, before M5a
(in M5.0 or a session of its own).

**From P38 (M4.4a, record 0022 item 3):** a non-type template argument keeps no `expr` in this configuration
(`BACKING_EXPR_FOR_NONTYPE_TEMPL_ARG` is false), so `t<0u - 1u>()` reaches an instance as the plain constant
`4294967295U`, which cannot be told from a literal. Under 0022 (no wrapping) M5 must not trust such a constant: check a
template argument's conversion at the place where it is written (the template-id in the caller), or reject arguments
that are not literals, decided in M5a's record.

The M3 handoff §6 still holds: VIR's `IntType` needs a type form for `T`; templates in verified files are rejected
today (`encode.cpp:1462-1467` declarations, `:1495-1497` routines, `:926-929` calls); generic proofs read contracts
from the root template; contracts can use lambdas naming `T`. Latent hazard: a template instance whose body is in a
verified file takes `callee_for_call`'s has-body path (`encode.cpp:911-915`) and would become a bodyless VIR
function with no `trusted_reason`; only the declaration-level rejection keeps it unreachable today — M5e must handle
instances before that rejection is lifted.

**M5a Eligibility** (cerastes-only; verification results unchanged).
- `src/backend/generic_eligibility.{h,cpp}`: `check_generic_eligibility(template, prototype)` → verdict (eligible;
  per type parameter opaque or integral; for ineligible ones a tag, a text and the first offending position). A
  pure function: no diagnostics, no exit status can change.
- Integral marks: only `eok_land` conjuncts of the four constraint places (il-inventory A2–A8); `std::integral`
  identified by entity (concept template `integral` in namespace `std`, through inline namespaces), argument the
  implicit one or one `tak_type` `tptk_param` at the template's depth, typerefs skipped. Other concepts,
  disjunctions, `!`, requires-expressions are ignored (they only narrow the instances; the parameter stays opaque).
- Value classes for dependent nodes (non-dependent subtrees are left to the encoder's own allow-list): Lit (`int`
  literal 0..32767), Val(p), Prom(p) (`+ - * / %` of one parameter, at most one literal), Bool (comparisons of one
  parameter; `&& || !`; `==`/`!=` on bools), Opaque(p) (`==`/`!=` of one opaque parameter in annotations only).
  `ck_template_param`/`tpck_expression` constants are looked inside (gotcha 6: `(T)100`); other tpck kinds fail.
  Conversions to `T` must be explicit casts of Val/Prom/NonDep builtin integers; an implicit promoted → `T`
  conversion (`return v + 1;`, no conversion node in the IL) is `conversion`.
- Tags: `member`, `nontype_parameter`, `template_template_parameter`, `parameter_pack`, `unnamed_parameter`,
  `spec_function`, `constexpr`, `signature_type` (`T*`, `T&`, `T&&`, `auto`, `Box<T>` — revisit `T*` with an opaque
  pointee now that M4.5 brings pointers), `default_argument`, `dependent_call` (incl. `old`/`forall`/`owns` over
  `T`), `member_access`, `pointer_operation`, `sizeof`, `cast`, `bitwise_or_shift`, `opaque_operation`, `operands`,
  `unary_arithmetic`, `increment_or_compound_assignment`, `conversion`, `not_bool`, `local_initializer`,
  `unsupported_statement`, `measure`, `unsupported_operation`, `internal`.
- Completeness backstop: a second pass with EDG's `traverse_statement`/`traverse_expr` (template-parameter
  constants included) collects every dependent node; one the classifier did not visit makes the template `internal`;
  a hook `--cerastes_generic_selftest` proves it fires.
- Observation: `--cerastes_generic` (cerastes-fe) adds to each function-template prototype in the walker listing
  `generic eligible T=integral U=opaque` or `generic ineligible <tag> @ L<n>:<c>: <text>`; harness header
  `// golden-options: --cerastes_generic` (only with `expect: golden`); the walker oracle counts the lines as a
  derived category (not IL facts). The 49 existing prototype goldens do not change.
- Tests: `tests/templates/eligibility/` (each ineligible tag next to its eligible minimal pair; verdicts
  pre-registered in `// verdict:` comments before goldens exist) and the six ports' verdicts
  (`tests/templates/verifast/`).
- Timeline: il-analyst probes P1–P8 (35 min box: `T i = 0` vs `(T)0`, contract param refs and opaque `r == x`,
  non-dependent calls in a prototype and `old(v)`, `t.m`/`-v`/`v++`/`v += 1`/`(int)v`/`sizeof(T)`/lambdas, parameter
  kinds, loops with attributes and `return v + 1`, `r == (0 <= v && v < 10)`, `a_constant.expr` vs `variant.expr`);
  test-mutator harness header + oracle category; orchestrator the record; edg-backend the checker; goldens checked
  by il-analyst; one Opus audit. Stop rules: cut the oracle's structural checks, then tag coverage automation, then
  `main` in the ports; any rule family not done by 2:10 returns ineligible "not checked" (fail closed).

**M5b EDG (box).** Best just before M5g. Fork commit Q: a registration flag
refusing an accumulating attribute that first appears on a later declaration (check site
`attach_decl_attributes_to_entity`, `decls.c:806-812`, next to `reconcile_must_match_attributes`,
`attribute.c:4131-4230`; next free flag bit `0x8`, `attribute.h:401-437`; precedent
`ec_comparison_defaulted_in_class_must_be_first_decl`, `decls.c:10631`; `first_decl` is set on namespace-scope
paths — check member and template paths; GH tests in `tests/tests/changes/GH-*.sft.cpp` with an `-ok` companion,
`src/Changes`, `doc/source/ext_intf.rst`); cerastes registers it for `predicate`/`pure`
(`register_attributes.cpp:51-52`). Fork commit R: EDG diagnoses series L's silent error node for a `decltype(p)`
lambda parameter (§3, "M5.0 and M5"); the `decltype` tests move from `cerastes-annotation_substitution_error` to EDG's diagnostic
at the same line (owner's rule). Plus the close-out audit B's missing tests (§3, "M5.0 and M5"). Fail-before/pass-after,
Opus audit, the full box suites (baseline mismatches `cwg1835`, `cwg2881`), pin move, 0006/0007 and the upstream
draft amended. Stop rules: box unavailable → topic branch, pin moved in a short follow-up; new box mismatch → no pin
move.

**M5c Generic infrastructure and opaque `T`.** A generic Viper method per eligible template, verified even when
nothing instantiates it; calls of instances and ineligible templates stay rejected. Opaque `T`: one empty Viper
domain per type parameter, admitted by `lint_viper.py` only after `// cerastes:opaque-type <template> <param>
<reason>`, with an empty body and a `c_T_` name; `==`/`!=` between values of one opaque parameter. Soundness
(parametricity): no functions, axioms or quantifiers over the sort, so validity over every non-empty interpretation
covers each instance; instances restricted to M3's scalar types (integers and `bool`; floating point excluded, NaN).
VeriFast in Docker (`--platform linux/amd64`, image digest pinned in 0001, `~/Documents/verifast/bin` mounted
read-only, both provers as `verifast_both`), recorded outcomes of the six originals in
`tests/differential/verifast/recorded/` so `check.sh` never needs Docker. Stop rules: F11 (non-dependent calls in a
prototype) not resolving → reject those calls and record; Docker not working in 30 min → run it on the box in M5b.

**M5d Integral `T`.** Four ghost formals per integral parameter (`T_MIN`, `T_MAX`, `PT_MIN`, `PT_MAX`) with
VeriFast's linear constraints as method `requires` (`127 <= T_MAX <= 2^128-1`, `-T_MAX-1 <= T_MIN <= 0`,
`T_MAX <= PT_MAX`, `INT_MAX <= PT_MAX <= 2^128-1`, `-PT_MAX-1 <= PT_MIN <= T_MIN`; INT_MAX from EDG's target): no
domain, no axiom, no assume. Signedness unknown: every symbolic operation is checked as signed against symbolic
bounds (sound for unsigned instances: a result in range means the wrap is the identity); M3's shortcuts that assume
symmetric ranges (`lower.cpp:236` unary minus `a != lo`, `:301` division `!(a == lo && b == -1)`) are not reused —
the general range check on the result instead. `promoted(T) = PT`, `usual_arithmetic(PT, int) = PT` computed by
cerastes (the IL types dependent operations `tptk_unknown`). `cerastes --selftest` checks every target integer type
except `bool` satisfies the constraints; the `consistent` must-fail test (`check(false)`) shows they are not
vacuous. Port `integral_wrong_spec` here (no `main`, no instances), its expectations written from the record before
the first run. Risk: `v * v` against symbolic bounds slow in Z3. Stop rule: loops in generic bodies move to M5f.

**M5e Instances, call sites, fallback, reporting.** Callers call each instance's own method (the M3 encoder on the
instance IL, the contract from the root template, 0006). One Silicon run holds every generic method and every
instance method; the position map gains a `#method` table (first/last line, role, template, display name). Per
template: generic verified → covered (a covered instance that fails is exit 3, "discrepancy" — owner question);
generic failed and instances exist → the generic's errors hidden, the instances' results count (notes
`in the instantiation f<long>`); generic failed and no instance → the generic's errors reported. Coverage: integral
arguments builtin integers other than `bool`; opaque arguments M3 scalar types; not an explicit specialization; not
in a recursion cycle. Notes on stdout after the verdict: `<file>:<line>: note: per-instantiation|not-generic|
not-verified: …`, pinned by `// expect: note <kind> @ L<n>`; 0011 items 9–10, `tests/README.md` and
`parse_verify_output` amended. The count `n`: plain bodies + one per template verified once + one per instance
verified separately. Port `integral_fallback`.

**M5f Specializations, recursion, headers, correspondence.** Explicit specializations verified as plain functions
with the primary's contract (EDG enforces must-match), never covered; specializations of system templates stay
rejected; explicit instantiations are ordinary instances (differs from VeriFast). Call graph keyed by instance
routine; a template in a cycle is not covered (Viper checks a measure only within an SCC of the emitted graph).
Templates in user headers verified per including unit; system templates only through contracts.
`internal/soundness/prototype-correspondence.md` finished (each session adds the constructs it accepts) with an
il-analyst oracle comparing prototype and instance listings for every builtin integer type. Mutation run on
`tests/templates`.

**M5g Gate G2.** Ports in `tests/templates/verifast/` with adaptation headers and line maps to the originals;
`scripts/vf_mutants.py` applies each `mutate.py` edit to the original through the map; VeriFast on originals and
mutants; `internal/differential.md`. Agreement: the same verdict and, when both fail, the same failing lines (and
the same path, generic or per instance). Explained, non-blocking classes: the C meaning of contract arithmetic (0010
item 11), unsigned wrapping, termination (0013), the eligibility path when the verdict agrees, limits from the
target. Anything else stops the session and blocks M6. G2 scope: `integral` (with `pick(1, p)`, pointers from
M4.5), `integral_fallback`, `integral_per_instantiation` (with `low_bit`, bitwise from M4.4),
`integral_wrong_spec`, and `generic_body`'s `copy_through_locals` (adapted: `T z = y;`), `second`,
`declared_first`; **deferred to M7** (owner): `generic_body`'s `assign`/`same_ref` and
`function_template_general_contract`.

**Questions to settle before M5c** (ask then): a failing covered instance → exit 3 (recommended) or ignored as in
VeriFast; notes on stdout with `expect: note` lines; the agreement definition and its explained classes.

## 5. Known gaps carried

- Termination: a recursion cycle through another unit (0013 item 5) — the contract manifest, M6 (M7 if it does not fit).
- The `predicate`/`pure` marker on the first declaration — M5b (an EDG registration feature).
- Still rejected for `forall` in templates: a lambda depending on `T` only through `decltype` of a function parameter
  (above), function parameter packs (`attr_function_parameter_pack`), `sizeof...` of a template pack, a lambda that
  names the template it is in (`h` undefined). EDG bug 0021 does not arise: cerastes reads C++ in Clang emulation.
- Closed: the five compile-time uses of `constexpr` spec functions that left no trace (P, registered).
- Attributes in positions where EDG records nothing (0011 item 7); M3's rejected constructs (0012 item 12) for M4 and M8.
- From M4.2a (0015): a `goto` that enters a block, an `if` branch or a switch body (C allows it; Silicon's handling
  of a jump into an `if` branch is unproven, S9d); a label that is the whole branch of an `if` without braces; GNU
  computed `goto`; `quick_exit`, `__builtin_trap`, `__builtin_unreachable`/`unreachable()`, `std::terminate`; an
  `assert` in a `for` increment. Each is rejected with a diagnostic and an M8 entry (glibc's `assert` expansion is
  recognised since S5, record 0031 item 5).
  A `goto` into a block or an `if` branch is lifted only when a ported example needs it, after a Silicon spike with
  must-fail twins (owner, 2026-10-27, §8 question 5).

## 6. Process notes

- **What keeps a session short:** fixed scope with stop rules; the owner's decisions and pre-approved expectation
  changes asked up front, each with a concrete default; the record written while the probes' results come in, audited in
  the background; three agents with disjoint files; single-file runs during the work.
- **Worktree.** Each session creates its own worktree, `.claude/worktrees/<session>` on its branch from `origin/main`
  (`git worktree add .claude/worktrees/m4.5b2b -b <branch> origin/main`; the old `.claude/worktrees/m4.2b1` is gone since
  M4.5b2b), with its submodules cloned with `--reference` to the main checkout's module stores (`third_party/edg`,
  `third_party/silicon`, then `silver` inside it), then `scripts/bootstrap.sh`. A shell `cd` elsewhere may leave the
  worktree: name it in every command.
- **Builds and baselines.** Take the baseline (`run_tests.py -j 8`, `build/vpr` → `build/<session>-baseline-vpr`, the VIR
  self-test into `build/<session>-baseline-vir`) before any build; agents edit meanwhile but build only after it, with
  `lockf build/<session>/build.lock cmake --build build/cmake`, and nothing builds while `check.sh` runs. A session that
  moves the pin runs `check.sh` once early.
- **A baseline that agents cannot disturb** (M4.5b1a; from M4.5b2b in a detached worktree of its own,
  `.claude/worktrees/<session>-base` at the starting commit, so the main checkout is never touched): its own `build/` and
  `build/vpr`, copied into the session worktree's `build/<session>-baseline-vpr`. Then the
  worktree's build is free for the implementers from the start; in M4.5b1a an agent's build relinked `build/cerastes`
  under a baseline that shared it. Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` in the worktree first when it was last built for another
  branch (a stale EDG stamp stops `run_tests.py`).
- **Dependabot and the CI guard** (M4.5b1c1): `scripts/test_run_tests.py`'s `CiGuardTests` holds a model of
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with every action's SHA, and record 0001 lists them; a Dependabot bump changes only
  `ci.yml`, so `main` failed the harness self-test from PR #16's merge (`fca0cbc`, `actions/setup-python` v7.1.0) until
  this branch updated both. Each later bump needs the same two edits (or a change to the guard).
- **Viper against the baseline without Silicon** (M4.5b1c1): regenerating every kept `.vpr` and `.map` with
  `build/cerastes` and comparing them byte for byte with the baseline's (`build/m4.5b1c1/lower/vpr_one.sh`, about 30 min
  under load) answers "did any existing program's Viper change" long before `check.sh`; give each concurrent run its
  own output directory (two runs sharing one raced and printed false `MISSING` lines).
- **Parallel Silicon runs saturate the Mac** (M4.5b1b: load averages up to 215 while an agent ran a test directory and
  another timed programs): time single programs only on a quiet machine, and say so with each timing.
- **Twins and Silicon's continuation:** after a failed check Silicon goes on with the failing value unconstrained, so a
  twin whose failed read flows into an `ensures` fails twice; give such twins an `ensures` that holds for any value.
- **Compiler matrices** (P41, P48, P50): clang and GCC, both modes, three tiers (no flag, `-Wall`, `-Wall -Wextra`); the
  union rule of 0020 item 5 rejects what warns at the first two tiers. Measure the near misses too, natively: a positive
  that holds them must compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- **Mutation** runs once, after the last rebuild, alone on a quiet machine, with no external cap below the driver's
  `--timeout` (M4.4b1: a SIGKILLed driver orphans Silicon). `mutate.py` reports progress on stderr; check `date` against
  the budget before starting.
- **Commits.** `git add <paths> && git commit` commits everything staged, including an earlier `git rm`: delete a retired
  test in the working tree, and stage the deletion only in the commit that lands its feature. No Claude trailer; never
  push.
- **Doc pitfalls.** `[[cerastes::owning]]` in prose becomes an anchor (with `::`, even `+…+` and `{empty}` leave one, and
  `check_doc_examples`' source lint refuses `++…++`): name the attribute (`cerastes::owning`) and let the example show
  the brackets; a code span holding `**` needs `+…+`, or `pass:[…]` when it also holds ` + `; a backtick next to a double quote
  (`` `*q`" ``) is a curved quote and breaks the span (M4.5b1c3). `[[noreturn]]` in text becomes an anchor even inside `+…+`; `__name` in backticks needs `+…+`; a
  possessive after a code span breaks the next span; `pass:[…]` holding `<` or `>` is refused by
  `check_doc_examples.py` (write `+…+`). `build_docs.sh` and `check_doc_examples.py --html build/doc` catch them.
- **A test that loses an `expect:` line** (pre-approved) keeps its line numbers with a comment in its place
  (M4.4c, the four `reject_assert_shape_*.c`).

## 7. Acceptance

Each session's acceptance commands are in its plan (`.claude/plans/`); the results of finished sessions are in
`internal/status.md` (the latest entry) and the commits its history names.

## 8. Questions for the owner

Each has a recommended answer. Answer inline, as before. Answered questions 1–84 are recorded in the decision records,
the session plans and the handoffs reachable from the one named at the top. The latest: 65 (`return &local;` rejected
like the compilers), 66 (the cost of aliasing parameters, M4.8), 67 (the `owns`+`reads` rule path-precise), 68 (b1c3
may re-expect the three pinned false alarms of reassigned parameters, §4.2); at M4.5b1c2's planning (2026-10-29): 69
(the upstream EDG merge and the pin move wait for the box session, §4.1), 70 (unsequenced accesses that name one object
are rejected like the compilers, `unsequenced_modification`; the shapes that depend on aliasing are path-precise
`unsequenced`), 71 (b1c2 has no time cap and no cuts), 72 (after audit round 1's S7: an `ensures` atom is returned only
where its `requires` partner was taken, checked in `f__wf` for every contract, record 0039 item 7); at M4.5b1c3's
planning (2026-10-30): 73 (atoms in a `do … while (0)` invariant stay rejected, like atoms in a `check`), 74
(`owns(**pp)` and reads of `**pp` in a contract move to M4.5c), 75 (`owning` beside an explicit `owns(*p)` or `p == NULL
|| owns(*p)` on the same parameter is merged; `reads`, `live` or another guard beside it is rejected), 76 (pointers to
pointers at any depth), 77 (sessions sized to one context, under about 12 h unless a reason is given).

At M4.5b2a's planning (2026-10-30): 78 (`const` objects are modelled in M4.6, the recommendation; §4.3), 79 (written
atoms on moved pointers are fixed in M4.8 with question 66, the recommendation; §4.3), 80 (a `static` local's
permission reaches its function by an implicit `owns` in its contract and in every caller's, `main` from
`program_start`), 81 (M4.5b2a's flips, §4.2), 82 (the call's flag row becomes `uninitialized`, in M4.5b2b, §4.2), 83
(under `--strict-init` an initialized pointee passed to a `ref_to_uninit` parameter is a static rejection, M4.5b2b,
§4.2), 84 (initial values by linkage: internal linkage and C's external linkage get the initializer's value, C++'s
external linkage an unknown one; M4.5b2a's plan).

At M4.5b2b's planning (2026-11-02, each the recommendation; recorded in its plan and record 0042): 85 (every call flag
row becomes `uninitialized`, global and `static`-local atoms included; `selftest_cases12.inc:113, :206, :283` join
question 82's pre-approved re-expected pins), 86 (contract reads of a marked parameter's pointee are rejected statically,
`*p` in a `must_init` parameter's `ensures` excepted), 87 (after a `ref_to_uninit` call an initialized pointee stays
initialized: `old(flag) ==> flag`, amending 0028 item 14), 88 (a marker needs an `owns(*p)` atom, explicit or from
`owning`, and `must_init` one in the `ensures` too; `reads(*p)` beside a marker is rejected).

No question is open.
